// stress test for the "reset forever" timer pattern
// reset forever pattern is commonly used for keep alive test: the desired
// semantic is "do not make a move as long as some condition holds", while
// "some condition" can be satisfied via handling certain events
// with a event loop that does not support reset (i.e. unset, since reset is
// effectively unset than set), reset forever pattern can only be approximated
// with a "aliveness" flag and a periodical "check liveness" timer. the
// downsides include
// * when state machine may only take action on check liveness timer alarm,
//   which is somewhere (T, 2T] after the liveness go off, where T is the check
//   liveness interval. there's no way for state machine to take action exactly
//   after a fixed delay
//   (it's true that state machine may take action at any time may not be the
//   desired behavior in some case, i'm just talking about user loses an option)
// * the meaning of timer is weakened. it has to be paired with a flag state to
//   restore the original intent. in another word, the expressiveness is
//   degraded
// this codebase requires event loop to not only support unset timers, but in
// a semantically strong way: it must support reliably cancellation of timers.
// in another word, a timer is guaranteed to not go off as soon as it has been
// unset. in the context of reset forever pattern, it means as soon as you reset
// a timer, it will be reliably postponed, will not alarm at the original
// deadline under any circumstance
//
// while this is great for application, event loop must carefully implement it
// to ensure constant timer overhead over time. with current tokio based
// implementation, the latency overhead is constant, while memory consumption
// keeps growing. there's probably no memory leak, just tokio is not reclaiming
// dead tasks as fast as event loop creating new ones
// anyway this stress test is just for future proof. currently there's no
// protocol taking reset forever pattern, and presumably no protocol will ever
// take it in such a tight loop
// the ever growing memory consumption issue could be solved if i don't spawn
// a task for every `set`. currently the reset intent is not passed to timer
// service: all it can see is a `unset` immediately followed by a `set`. if we
// pass down the reset intent, and manage to make use of tokio's `Sleep::reset`
// method (yeah it's all about that: i'm unhappy just because there's a reset
// available while my codebase is not using it), maybe the event loop can
// perform better in this stress test, hopefully
